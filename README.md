# landing-page-project

For this project we're creating an entire web page from a design that will be provided. 

The provided design comes in the form of 2 images:
one is an image of the complete website, and one
has some details about some of the fonts and colors we've used.

The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

* An easy way to give credit is to put the creator's name and contact info in a README file in your repository.
